# czy-in-various-languages
This is the code I wrote and used over the last years for my research project of 'CZY' particle.

The whole presentation is located here https://bomgii.github.io/czy-in-various-languages/

This is not the last and definitive version, however, general trends in the data are quite obvious from this presentation.
Please, feel free to contact me about this project.
